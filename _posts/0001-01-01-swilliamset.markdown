<!-- Tell us a little about yourself. -->

I am Senior UX Engineer at ExactTarget. Homoe is just a short bike ride up the [Cultural Trail](http://www.indyculturaltrail.org/) from Fletcher Place home of Indy's new favorite restraunt [Bluebeard](http://bluebeardindy.com/). In fact it's not that much further to just ride up the monon trail to the [Speak Easy](http://www.speakeasyindy.com/) to learn about awesome things like git. I stay connected and share with the Indy Tech community via twitter under [@swilliamset](http://twitter.com/swilliamset)

<!-- Tell us something interesting. -->

My wife and I are expecting to deliver our 5th child any day now.
